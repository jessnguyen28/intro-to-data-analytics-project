# ðŸ“Š Marketing Classifier Machine Learning Project  
**UTS Subject: Introduction to Data Analytics (2025)**
Project by Jessica Nguyen

## Project Overview  
This individual project involved building and evaluating five different machine learning classifiers to predict customer subscription behaviour from a real-world marketing dataset. The task was completed individually and aimed to apply foundational machine learning techniques alongside critical thinking and structured reporting.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Explore the dataset and identify relevant features for prediction  
- Build and compare multiple classification models using Python  
- Evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics  
- Summarise findings in a structured, professional report  

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Techniques  
- **Python (VS Code)**  
- **Machine Learning Models**:  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Neural Network  
- **Model Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - Accuracy  
  - F1 Score  
  - ROC Curve  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, encoding, and train/test splitting

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Deliverables  
- A detailed **33-page report** covering:  
  - Data exploration  
  - Model selection  
  - Performance comparisons  
  - Insights and recommendations  
- Graphs and visualisations to support model evaluation  
- Reflections on classifier strengths, weaknesses, and real-world applicability

## âœ… Key Skills Demonstrated  
- Independent project management  
- Technical analysis and reporting  
- Python coding and scikit-learn usage  
- Interpreting and communicating complex results for non-technical audiences
